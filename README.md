# Utility_AI_Unity

Small personal project to learn about Utility AI and how to use curves to fetch results to determine what action to take.
The is an Unity project where I am creating a small RTS like game with 2 AIs collecting resources, creating units and defeating its opponent.

# Planning
- Setup the structure for the Utility AI
- Curves
  -   Linear
  -   Quadratic
  -   Logistic
  -   Logit
- Enemy Actions
  -   Build Resource Buildings
  -   Expand territory
  -   Build Armies
  -   Defeat the opponent

# Desmos

I use desmos to visualize my curves they can be found in the following links.
If the link is not yet there this means I am still implementing it.

- Quadratic Curve https://www.desmos.com/calculator/abxfujakzv
- Logistic
- Logit
