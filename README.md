# Utility_AI_Unity

Small personal project to learn about Utility AI and how to use curves to fetch results to determine what action to take.
The is an Unity project where I am creating a small RTS like game with 2 AIs collecting resources, creating units and defeating its opponent.

# Planning

# Desmos

I use desmos to visualize my curves they can be found in the following links.
If the link is not yet there this means I am still implementing it.
